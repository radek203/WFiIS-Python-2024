Recently, we discussed the emergence of high performance programming languages. These kinds of languages are booming due to the vast amounts of data that needs to be processed nowadays. As a result, C and C++ are doing well in the top 10 and Rust seems to be a keeper in the top 20. But further down the list, there is another remarkable competitor of C and C++ entering the top 50. No, it is not Google's highly promoted language Carbon, which is only at position #168. It is the programming language Zig. Zig is a very pragmatic language that interacts smoothly with C/C++ programs, thus making it is easy to migrate from C/C++ to Zig. It has all the nice features of C and C++ (such as explicit memory management enhanced with option types) and has abandoned the not-so-nice features (such as the dreadful preprocessing). Entering the top 50 is no guarantee to become a success, but it is at least a first noteworthy step. Good luck Zig! -- Paul Jansen CEO TIOBE Software --
